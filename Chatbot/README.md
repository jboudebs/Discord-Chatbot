    * idBot and token in order to connect the bot. The idBot has to be the id from the DB and the token must be the one given for the bot by Discord
    * idBot and brain in order to add or change the brain of the bot. The idBot has to be the id from the DB and the brain must be a real path.
4) DELETE : add in the body the following keys :
    * idBot to delete the bot. The idBot has to be the id from the DB.
